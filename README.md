# Treasure Hunt


 In development by Jihye Sofia Seo https://www.linkedin.com/in/jihyeseo
 
 forked from the code of another game Slide Puzzle by Al Sweigart  
 http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapter4.html 
 whose books are very helpful for learning Python and PyGame. 
 Many thanks!

 The final goal is an autoplay with computer vision, 
 so that one can earn more scores in a mobile game "Tiny Farm - Safari Game"   http://tinyfarm.wikia.com/wiki/Tiny_Zoo
